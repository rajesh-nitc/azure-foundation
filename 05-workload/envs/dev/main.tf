# Not creating module for this as the purpose is to test the following:

# We should be able to ssh into it using bastion in hub vnet
# We should be able to talk to storage service using az cli from within vm

# As we have setup the application rules, network rules and nat rules in the previous stage:
# This vm should be able to talk to google.com
